# Basics

## Hellow world

This file will help set up your first programme in C and make sure everything is working.

## data types

This file will show you examples of different data types in C
| Data type | Expample |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `int` | `int age = 10;` |
| `char` | `char character = 'c';` |
| `double` | `double age = 10.5;` |
| `string` | `char name[] = 'your name';` |
| `Float` | `float age = 10.5;` |
| `Void` | |
| `long` | `long age = 10;` `long double age = 10;` |
| `short` | `short age = 10;` |
| `unsigned` | `unsigned int x;` |
| `signed` | `unsigned int x;` |
| `boolean` | `TRUE FALSE` |

## Selction

This file will shows and explains you the basics if statements work.

```c
if(){

}
```

```c
if(){

}else{

}
```

```c
if(){

} else  if(){

} else{

}
```

## Iteration

This file will shows and explains to you the basics itration (looping) using `while` and `for` loops.

```c
for(int i = 0; i < sizeof(array)/sizeof(datatype); i++){

}
```

```c
while( var < num){

}
```

## Importing (`#include`)

This file explains how to use importing works in C and how to use the `#incude` key word to include libraries in you programme

## Memory management

This file shows and explains how to memory works in C . showing 2 ways of allocating memory using `malloc` and `calloc`, how to reallocate memory `realloc`, freeing memory and how pointer work with memory including what pointer are using the syntax `int *var` to declear a pointer and `&var` to get a pointer.

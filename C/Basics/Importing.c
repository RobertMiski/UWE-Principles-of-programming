/* 
imorting libraries are a big part of programming it allows you to reuse yuor own code or someone else.

we have been using importing from the begining the #include <stdio.h> is importing the stdio library so we can use prinf()
function, and in the data types file we imported the stdbool through <stdbool.h>.

to import a library you have to import the header file that why it's stdio.h, header file define all of the avalible functions
and vaiables you're able to use.

# Header files

This folder will show you how to use header files so you can seprate your functions into different files if needed.

As we are using more then on .c file we are going to have to use the built in terminal to vs code to open the terminal press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `p` and then type `Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal`.

To compile and run the file use `gcc *.c -o Output && Output.exe` in the terminal, this will compile all .c files, create Output.exe from them and then run the executable.

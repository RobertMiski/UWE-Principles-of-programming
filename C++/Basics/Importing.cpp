// to import a header file we use #include (same as in C) <iostream> in our case other examples : #include <Math.h> a library
// that has numerous maths functions. Iostream has the basic functions required for you to run a program eg: cout<<"message";
// cout gives you the output of your desired message on the terminal
// another example would be cin>>variable; here you put a variable that you choose as an input in order to use it later

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
    {
        cout <<"Hello World"<<" ";
   
        return 0; 
    }
